# Nuxt.js / Apollo / JWT

> Nuxt, with Apollo Authorization using JWT

This example _does not_ include session logic, as I felt that would over-complicate the repo, and they're really two distinct pieces of functionality.  So this example assumes the JWT has already been received/extracted/etc..  For an example for handling sessions, check out the [Nuxt Auth Routes](https://nuxtjs.org/examples/auth-routes) example.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
